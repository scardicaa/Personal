# My dear Bri,

I am the luckiest man to have met you in my life. What I thought was just going to be another tiring Valorant game, turned out to be meeting the most beautiful person in my life, a moment I wouldn't trade for anything.
You have taught me so many things, made me overcome so many of my fears and anxieties, and I have nothing to offer but my gratitude and love for you. I have not once met a person who held no judgement against me,
that I wasn't afraid to be vulnerable with despite the many times I told myself not to. To say that I am grateful of everything you do would be an understatement.
I enjoy my time with you every single day, and I will continue to do so for as long as I live. I have not once regretted any point of time or moment with you, as they have all always either taught me something, or made me
love you even more than I ever could. You are one of my best of friends, and I wouldn't trade you for the world. If anything, I'd trade the world for you.

With every smile and every laugh you share, you light up lives. And I have been one of the lucky ones to be able to achieve that. I am honoured, if anything, to have you by my side. You are brilliant, you are beautiful, you are wonderful. The room radiates any time you walk through a door. I couldn't imagine a timeline where I had never met you, and I even believe that no matter what past or future life, I will find you someway and somehow. I love you, Bri, so very much. Happy birthday, love.
